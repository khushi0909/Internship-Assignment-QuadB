# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Internship-Assignment-QuadB

We would like you to create a 2 screen React JS application using this 
API: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all
Please visit this API endpoint to understand the structure of the response.

We need you to create a basic UI to display the show names and a few details about it (you can choose what you want to display along with the show name). Include a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show. (Refer to the api structure. You will find a summary section for each show there.). We need you to complete this assignment and upload it to a GitHub Repository marked as Public and email us back the link to the repository (check the contact section for the email address).


Please note: 
It has to be a React JS application.
It has to implement the API and not just hardcode data from the API.
It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly an image(UI is completely up to you) and another screen to show it’s summary.
The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details.
(Reload should not happen)
(Use local/session storage for storing user details)
A proper UI so that we know you have a good understanding of UI/UX. Doesn’t need to have mind blowing animations but just basic HTML and CSS styling that looks good (You may use bootstrap).
Please use proper Component file structure.
